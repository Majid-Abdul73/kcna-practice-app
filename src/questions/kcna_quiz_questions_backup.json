      "It provides a stable ClusterIP for load balancing.",
      "It automatically creates an external load balancer for the Service.",
      "It allows direct Pod IP discovery via DNS, often used with StatefulSets.",
      "It encrypts all traffic to the Pods it selects.",
      "It exposes Pods on every node using a fixed NodePort."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "A headless Service (clusterIP: None) does not get a ClusterIP. Instead, DNS queries for the Service name return the IP addresses of the individual backing Pods. This is useful for peer-to-peer discovery or when clients need to connect to specific Pod instances, common with StatefulSets.",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Within the same namespace, a short Service name (e.g., my-svc) is sufficient for DNS resolution because the namespace is part of the Pod's DNS search path. For cross-namespace, my-svc.my-ns or the FQDN my-svc.my-ns.svc.cluster.local would be used.",

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "High cardinality occurs when a metric has many unique combinations of label values (e.g., using user ID or request ID as a label).

    "explanation": "Limits enforce resource caps. If a Pod frequently hits its memory limit, it gets OOMKilled (unstable). If it frequently hits its CPU limit, it gets throttled (poor performance).

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Network glitches or brief spikes can cause alert conditions to flap. The for clause requires a condition to be continuously true for a specified duration (e.g., 5 minutes) before the alert transitions from pending to firing state and gets sent to Alertmanager, reducing noise from transient issues.",

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Since Git is the source of truth, the Git history (commits, authors, timestamps) serves as a detailed audit log of all changes to the desired state.
